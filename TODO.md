Ranked by priority with higher having greatest priority:

>>> Edit 'GSC_ESP.ino' to transmit/receive/print between the LoRa's. This is proof of concept for integration into GSC Jetson Nano GUI.
>> Establish GUI for Jetson utilizing 'gsc_dashboard.py' and 'gsc_main.py' as well as dir archive.
> Add debug from TS ESP -> TS Teensy in 'TS_ESP.ino'. Currently, TS Teensy echoes the command sent to control the relays rather than useful debug.
